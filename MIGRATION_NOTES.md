# Migration Notes: FAMOS-exact preprocessing

Tracks the switch of `dtt/preprocessing.py` from the previous "close but not
exact" FAMOS approximation to the verified-exact recipe (reverse engineered
against `data/Fx_raw_cut.csv`, a matched raw-vs-processed FAMOS export). See
`famos_preprocess.py` for the reference implementation and validation numbers
this migration is targeting.

## Step 1 — FiltLP: filtfilt -> lfilter (2026-08-09)

**File:** `dtt/preprocessing.py::butterworth_lpf` (imported by `signal_processor.py`
and used by `imc_reader.py::_assemble` via `apply_famos_recipe`). Also updated
the module docstring and the GUI tooltip in `gui/pages/preprocess_page.py`
that both asserted FiltLP was zero-phase.

**Before:** `scipy.signal.filtfilt` — forward-backward, zero-phase Butterworth.
**After:** `scipy.signal.lfilter` — causal, single-pass Butterworth. Signature
unchanged (`butterworth_lpf(x, cutoff, order, fs)`).

**Why:** Reverse-engineered against a matched raw-vs-processed FAMOS export
(`data/Fx_raw_cut.csv`, columns `Lat_raw_cut` -> `Lat_lpf_cut`, order 4, cutoff
5 Hz). `filtfilt` only reached r = 0.93 with ~0.66 max abs error against the
real FAMOS `Latacc_LPF` column; `lfilter` matches it almost exactly. FAMOS's
own FiltLP is documented as a causal filter (the "0, 0" leading args in the
macro select causal mode; zero-phase is a separate Professional-edition
`FiltLPZ` operator FAMOS did not use here).

**Validation:** `lfilter` output vs `Lat_lpf_cut`, skipping the first/last N
samples of the cut to let the filter's startup transient settle (N=300 was
too tight — the transient does not fully decay until ~1000 samples in; the
reference script `famos_preprocess.py` uses N=3000 for this channel):

| skip | max abs err | mean abs err | r |
|---|---|---|---|
| 300  | 3.120e-03 | 6.048e-06 | 0.999999973 |
| 1000 | 5.014e-06 | 2.604e-07 | 1.000000000 |
| 3000 | 5.014e-06 | 2.695e-07 | 1.000000000 |

Matches the target (max abs error ~5e-6, r = 1.000000000).

**Consumers of the lateral channel now see a real causal lag** (this is
correct — it matches FAMOS, not a regression).

**Check 1 — downstream lag audit:** grepped every consumer of `Latacc` /
`Lat_acc` (`preprocessing.py`, `signal_processor.py`, `imc_reader.py`,
`famos_validation.py`, GUI pages, `generate_sample_data.py`). None combine
`Latacc` with another channel in a way that assumes zero lag (no load-transfer
or cross-channel correlation code touches it) — it is only ever smoothed,
displayed, or independently plotted/exported. The one general-purpose
cross-correlation utility that touches channel alignment, `dtt/spectral.py::
estimate_lag` (used by `gui/pages/signals_page.py` for manual channel
alignment in the UI), is unaffected: it now correctly measures the real lag
`Latacc` carries, which is the FAMOS-accurate behaviour. No fix needed.
